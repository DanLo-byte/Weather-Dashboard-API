# Weather-Dashboard-API

## Mission Statement

Developers can use third-party APIs to access their data and capabilities by sending requests to a URL with appropriate parameters. Developers are frequently charged with retrieving data from another app's API and incorporating it into their own. The goal of your project is to create a weather dashboard that runs in the browser and uses dynamically updated HTML and CSS. 

To get meteorological data for cities, we use the OpenWeather One Call API. Setup and usage instructions can be found in the documentation. Any permanent data will be stored in local Storage. 

Refer to the Full-Stack Blog on how to utilise API keys for more information on how to deal with the OpenWeather API.

## User Story

AS A traveler
I WANT to see the weather outlook for multiple cities
SO THAT I can plan a trip accordingly
## Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN a weather dashboard with form inputs
WHEN I search for a city
THEN I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history
WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index
WHEN I view the UV index
THEN I am presented with a color that indicates whether the conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe
WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity
WHEN I click on a city in the search history
THEN I am again presented with current and future conditions for that city
